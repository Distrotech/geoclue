2.1.6
=====

- Correct binary path is demo's desktop file.
- Move demo apps from /usr/share to /usr/libexec.

2.1.5
=====

- Add a NULL check to fix a crasher.
- Setup D-Bus policy to be able to access NetworManager API.
- Expected agent object path now static. This breaks agent interface but it was
  needed to fix the D-Bus policy.
- Fix issue of us giving every connection access to every property on the system
  bus.

2.1.4
=====

- Don't depend on unreleased libnm-glib.

2.1.3
=====

- Agents can now dictate maximum accuracy level allowed for all clients through
  a D-Bus property. The next version of gnome-shell will make use of that and
  provide an option to enable/disable geolocation in topbar menu.
- Add D-Bus property to specify available accuracy level. For now we just
  hardcode it to report that we can provide exact accuracy.
- Give agents time to register themselves on startup before processing client
  requests.
- Move configuration file under geoclue subdir so that in future we can easily
  add more configuration files if needed.
- Fixes to build.
- Some internal clean-ups.

2.1.2
=====

- Fix some crashing bugs.
- Ignore WiFis with '_nomap' suffix.
- Configure options for disabling WiFi, 3G and GPS modem sources.
- Avoid spaming the network resources for ignorable changes to network setup.
- Add some required files to distribution that we forgot in last release.

2.1.1
=====

- 3GPP-based geolocation source.
  - Uses ModemManager to get cell tower info from 3GPP modem and uses
    opencellid.org's public API to translate that into a location.
- GPS modem-based geolocation source: If your 3GPP modem has a GPS, geoclue can
  now make use of it.
- WiFi-based geolocation source
  - Uses Mozilla Location Service to find location based on nearby WiFi
    networks.
  - Refresh location on changes in WiFi networks.
  - Option in configuration file to make geoclue use Google Maps Geolocation API
    rather than Mozilla Location Service.
  - Option in configuration file to enable submission of wifi data to Mozilla
    Location Service. If this option is enabled, the data is submitted each time
    geoclue gets a GPS lock. That means, its not completely autonomous and data
    is only submitted if an application, e.g gnome-maps requests current
    location with exact accuracy.
- API for clients to specify what level of geolocation accuracy they need,
  e.g city-level, street-level or exact etc.
- API to check if geolocation service is in use. Next version of gnome-shell
  will make use of that to show an icon in the panel to indicate to user that
  their location is being accessed.
- Application authorization agent
  - Make agent completely optional. We will revert this once we have a reliable
    mechanism to identify applications.
  - Identify agent and client applications by their desktop IDs rather than
    paths of their binaries.
  - Ability for agents to dictate the accuracy level allowed for clients.
  - Maintain a whitelist of clients in configuration that do not need agent
    authorization.
- Avoid redundant queries to web services.
- Install demo applications and provide a desktop file for them.
- Many more internal fixes and clean-ups.

Dependency-related changes:

- Require libnm-glib >= 0.9.9.0 (new dependency)
- Require libmm-glib >= 1.0 (new dependency)
- Require libxml-2.0 (new dependency)

Note to package maintainers: This version drops the requirement for geoclue
binary to be given 'ptrace' capability that was introduced in last release,
2.1.0.

2.1.0
=====

- Application authentication agents support:
  - API for agents to register themselves.
  - API that agents need to implement.
  - configure option to enable requirement of authorization from agent. Until
    there is at least one agent out there, this requirement is disabled by
    default.
  - A demo agent.
  - Option in ${sysconfdir}/geoclue.conf containing whitelist of all our agents.
- Don't use proxy. Seems proxy settings are per-user and system users (which
  geoclue is supposed to run as) do not have access to them.
- Add support for bus-activation via systemd service unit.
- Add mandatory 'DesktopId' property to Client interface.
- Use HTTPS to connect to geoip.fedoraproject.org. The actual resource is behind
  HTTPS so using HTTP leads to redirections and thefore redundant TCP packets.
- Fixes to build system.

Note to package maintainers: For the agent support to work, geoclue binary
need 'ptrace' capability. In near future we will try to get this through systemd
so systemd-based distributions likely not need to bother about it. Having said
that, for this release you can simply keep the agent requirement disabled.
