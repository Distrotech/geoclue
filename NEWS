2.1.0
=====

- Application authentication agents support:
  - API for agents to register themselves.
  - API that agents need to implement.
  - configure option to enable requirement of authorization from agent. Until
    there is at least one agent out there, this requirement is disabled by
    default.
  - A demo agent.
  - Option in ${sysconfdir}/geoclue.conf containing whitelist of all our agents.
- Don't use proxy. Seems proxy settings are per-user and system users (which
  geoclue is supposed to run as) do not have access to them.
- Add support for bus-activation via systemd service unit.
- Add mandatory 'DesktopId' property to Client interface.
- Use HTTPS to connect to geoip.fedoraproject.org. The actual resource is behind
  HTTPS so using HTTP leads to redirections and thefore redundant TCP packets.
- Fixes to build system.

Note to package maintainers: For the agent support to work, geoclue binary
need 'ptrace' capability. In near future we will try to get this through systemd
so systemd-based distributions likely not need to bother about it. Having said
that, for this release you can simply keep the agent requirement disabled.
