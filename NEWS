2.2.0
=====

- Report 'Speed' and 'Heading' on location updates.
- Try to provide the most accurate location first.
- Avoid a crash by ensuring requested max accuracy is within bounds.
- Fix GPS coordinates parsing.
- Fix GeoIP on machines without WiFi hardware.
- Gracefully handle inexistent agent.
- Stop sources whose accuracy level becomes higher, rather than lower, than the
  requested level.
- Keep old location object alive on D-Bus for a bit longer to ensure
  applications are not accessing it still after it is destroyed.
- Don't enable the modem. Seems at least GNOME takes care of modem enabling for
  us and besides this shouldn't be done by geoclue anyway (see bug#85040).
- Wait for modem to be enabled before checking availability of location
  capabilities and using them. This is particularly important for pin-enabled
  modems.
- Ignore redundant GPS location updates.
- Fix some potential crashes.
- Some improvements to output of where-am-i demo application.

Dependency-related changes:

Explicitly require libsoup >= 2.42

2.1.10
======

- Disallow application if disabled explicitly in the configuration.
- Make it easy to add alternative modem source(s), e.g ofono-based.
- Map:
  - country-level accuracy to city-level since no source provides country-level
    accuracy.
  - neighborhood-level accuracy to city-level in WiFi source (only) so
    applications requesting neighborhood-level accuracy still get a location
    even if there is no modem available.
- Fixes to WiFi source.
- For easier debugging, add:
  - more debug prints.
  - commandline options to where-am-i demo application to specify timeout and
    requested accuracy level.
- Fix a potential build failure.

2.1.9
=====

- Move from NetworkManager to direct use of wpa_supplicant to retreive WiFI
  data, for greater portability.
- Port from opencellid.org to Mozilla Location Service for 3G-geolocation.
- Network data submission
  - Explicit option in config to enable submission.
  - Commandline options to enable network data submission and set nickname.
  - Submit 3G data.
  - Submit under 'geoclue' nick by default.
- Fix a few crashes.
- Drop now redundant workaround for pure geoip queries.
- Ability to mark an app as system component in the config so that
  - Agent can't decide its accuracy level nor agent is asked to authorize it.
    This mean automatic timezone in GNOME will continue working even if you
    disable geolocation.
  - app is not taken into account for 'InUse' property. That means you will no
    longer have to see location crosshair in gnome-shell's topbar forever just
    because you have automatic timezone enabled.
- Exit demo app if geoclue deactivates it.
- Improved debug log.
- Many other internal changes and minor improvements.

Dependency-related changes:

- Drop libnm-glib dependency
- Drop libxml2 dependency

2.1.8
=====

- Switch to Mozilla Location Service for geoip as well.
- Allow specifying nickname to submit network data with.
- Report actual available accuracy level and keep it up2date.
- Add 'Active' property to indicate client state.
- Expose altitude info (if known).
- Timeout on inactivity, rather than no clients.
- Automatically:
  - stop the client if max accuracy level is set to 0.
  - start the client if max accuracy level is set to non-0 and it was
    automatically stopped.
- Don't disable modem after using it. Disabling the modem, disables it for
  everyone so if there was an active connection going on through the modem,
  geoclue will cause it to disconnect. While we need to have some centralized
  means to enable/disable modem and ideally geoclue shouldn't do any
  enabling/disabling of modems at all, for now lets just only enable the
  modem.
- Fix issue of missed location updates.
- Whitelist correct ID for gnome-settings-daemon in default config.
- Replace '--disable-wifi-source' configure option with
  '--disable-network-manager'. i-e now you disable usage of NetworkManger
  explicitly rather than wifi source, which is now always built and enabled.
- Drop now redundant geoip server.
- Don't distribute .desktop.in files for demos.
- Plug some leaks.
- More debug log.
- Other minor fixes.

2.1.7
=====

- 'InUse' property now only affected by active clients. This fixes the issue of
  gnome-shell incorrectly showing 'geolocation in use' icon.
- Move DBus interface files to their canonical location:
  /usr/share/dbus-1/interfaces/.
- Drop redundant check for the C++ compiler in configure script.
- Demo agent now prints 'geolocation in use' info.

2.1.6
=====

- Correct binary path is demo's desktop file.
- Move demo apps from /usr/share to /usr/libexec.

2.1.5
=====

- Add a NULL check to fix a crasher.
- Setup D-Bus policy to be able to access NetworManager API.
- Expected agent object path now static. This breaks agent interface but it was
  needed to fix the D-Bus policy.
- Fix issue of us giving every connection access to every property on the system
  bus.

2.1.4
=====

- Don't depend on unreleased libnm-glib.

All contributors to this release:

Zeeshan Ali (Khattak) <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

2.1.3
=====

- Agents can now dictate maximum accuracy level allowed for all clients through
  a D-Bus property. The next version of gnome-shell will make use of that and
  provide an option to enable/disable geolocation in topbar menu.
- Add D-Bus property to specify available accuracy level. For now we just
  hardcode it to report that we can provide exact accuracy.
- Give agents time to register themselves on startup before processing client
  requests.
- Move configuration file under geoclue subdir so that in future we can easily
  add more configuration files if needed.
- Fixes to build.
- Some internal clean-ups.

2.1.2
=====

- Fix some crashing bugs.
- Ignore WiFis with '_nomap' suffix.
- Configure options for disabling WiFi, 3G and GPS modem sources.
- Avoid spaming the network resources for ignorable changes to network setup.
- Add some required files to distribution that we forgot in last release.

2.1.1
=====

- 3GPP-based geolocation source.
  - Uses ModemManager to get cell tower info from 3GPP modem and uses
    opencellid.org's public API to translate that into a location.
- GPS modem-based geolocation source: If your 3GPP modem has a GPS, geoclue can
  now make use of it.
- WiFi-based geolocation source
  - Uses Mozilla Location Service to find location based on nearby WiFi
    networks.
  - Refresh location on changes in WiFi networks.
  - Option in configuration file to make geoclue use Google Maps Geolocation API
    rather than Mozilla Location Service.
  - Option in configuration file to enable submission of wifi data to Mozilla
    Location Service. If this option is enabled, the data is submitted each time
    geoclue gets a GPS lock. That means, its not completely autonomous and data
    is only submitted if an application, e.g gnome-maps requests current
    location with exact accuracy.
- API for clients to specify what level of geolocation accuracy they need,
  e.g city-level, street-level or exact etc.
- API to check if geolocation service is in use. Next version of gnome-shell
  will make use of that to show an icon in the panel to indicate to user that
  their location is being accessed.
- Application authorization agent
  - Make agent completely optional. We will revert this once we have a reliable
    mechanism to identify applications.
  - Identify agent and client applications by their desktop IDs rather than
    paths of their binaries.
  - Ability for agents to dictate the accuracy level allowed for clients.
  - Maintain a whitelist of clients in configuration that do not need agent
    authorization.
- Avoid redundant queries to web services.
- Install demo applications and provide a desktop file for them.
- Many more internal fixes and clean-ups.

Dependency-related changes:

- Require libnm-glib >= 0.9.9.0 (new dependency)
- Require libmm-glib >= 1.0 (new dependency)
- Require libxml-2.0 (new dependency)

Note to package maintainers: This version drops the requirement for geoclue
binary to be given 'ptrace' capability that was introduced in last release,
2.1.0.

All contributors to this release:

Zeeshan Ali (Khattak) <zeeshanak@gnome.org>

2.1.0
=====

- Application authentication agents support:
  - API for agents to register themselves.
  - API that agents need to implement.
  - configure option to enable requirement of authorization from agent. Until
    there is at least one agent out there, this requirement is disabled by
    default.
  - A demo agent.
  - Option in ${sysconfdir}/geoclue.conf containing whitelist of all our agents.
- Don't use proxy. Seems proxy settings are per-user and system users (which
  geoclue is supposed to run as) do not have access to them.
- Add support for bus-activation via systemd service unit.
- Add mandatory 'DesktopId' property to Client interface.
- Use HTTPS to connect to geoip.fedoraproject.org. The actual resource is behind
  HTTPS so using HTTP leads to redirections and thefore redundant TCP packets.
- Fixes to build system.

Note to package maintainers: For the agent support to work, geoclue binary
need 'ptrace' capability. In near future we will try to get this through systemd
so systemd-based distributions likely not need to bother about it. Having said
that, for this release you can simply keep the agent requirement disabled.
